# Blood Test Data Analysis in R
  ## Project Overview
This project explores a clinical blood dataset using R. The objective was to clean the data, calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, and mode), and visualize the distribution of hemoglobin levels using histogram and density plots.
Tools Used

## R

tidyverse

ggplot2

## Data Cleaning Steps

Checked for missing values

Removed incomplete observations

Removed duplicate records

Converted relevant columns to numeric format

##  Statistical Analysis

The following descriptive statistics were calculated:

Mean

Median

Mode (custom function)

## Visualizations

Histogram of Hemoglobin levels

Density plot of Hemoglobin levels

## Skills Demonstrated

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Descriptive statistics

Data visualization

Custom function creation in R

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

##  Future Improvements

Compare hemoglobin levels by gender

Add boxplots for outlier detection

Conduct basic hypothesis testing
